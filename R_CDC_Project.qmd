## Questions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Q11

Address the values of each of the variables (use the codebook for this and include your answer as comments). For instance, is "none" equal to a value other than 0? Are there extra decimals implied? Are there other values that should be excluded based on the responses they represent? Which variable will you seek to predict from the other variables? Answer these questions in the *Q11 Discussion:* section below the code chunk. Update the dataset to account for these values for the remainder of the questions.

### Q11 Discussion:

I spent a few years working at the YMCA as a Personal Trainer and Group Exercise Instructor, and I spent alot of time with clients who struggled with Arthritis. I have heard many theories - founded and unfounded - as to the causes of Arthritis, and I have always been interested in the statistical backing behind these statements. Two contributors that I often heard from clients was either (a) their age, or (b) their weight. That is the main reason I have included these two variables in my study. As for cholesterol, recent studies have suggested that high cholesterol is positively correlated with Arthritis risk. For that reason, I was eager to include this variable in my study. Albeit, all of these variables are self reported, and there is room for error there. However, I can't foresee many reasons for a participant to lie about their weight and age on an anonymous study. Furthermore, the TOLDHI3 and HAVARTH5 variables are concerned with whether or not a doctor has informed the participant of their cholesterol/arthritis status or risk. There seems to be less chance of error here, compared to someone reporting whether or not they think they have the risk of either. So I can assume we have some good data here to give us a bird's eye view of the correlation between these variables, prompting further studies down the road. As for the WEIGHT2 variable, I chose to only include the "weight in lbs" variable, and to not spend time including the "kg" variables. The percentage of kg variables seemed miniscule enough to still get a decent grasp of the data, so I didn't want to fool with it. The HAVARTH5 and TOLDHI3 variables only had 4 categories, and removing the 7 and 9 categories brought the data to a binomial "yes" or "no". The _AGE_G variable didn't need to be cleaned at all (which was a relief). However, you will notice that a larger percentage of participants are older, which may skew the data. It makes sense to me that an older population would spend more time responding to a phone survey. My ultimate goal is to determine which, if any, of these variables are correlated with the risk of arthritis in these participants.

### Q12

Remove any outliers for each applicable variable. Make sure you are updating the dataset from Q11 and using this dataset for the remainder of the questions. Briefly explain why you chose the method you used in the *Q12 Discussion* section. Within your code chunk, provide comments explaining what your code is doing.

### Q12 Discussion:

I am choosing to use the 1.5 IQR method to remove the outliers for this dataset. The weight variable is the only variable with outliers. The rest of the data is categorical and cleaned. After running both the 1.5 IQR and 3SD removals on the dataset, you can see the summary statements that I have included. What I noticed is that the 1.5 IQR method removed quite a few more variables compared to the 3SD method, however, the summary variables are almost identical apart from the Max (300 for 1.5 IQR and 400 for 3SD). What I like about the 1.5 IQR method is that it very closely resembles the summary of the original dataset, apart from the Max. To me, that shows that this method will still reflect the original dataset well. The 3SD summary seems further away from the original data set by comparison, so I have opted for the 1.5 IQR method. I have renamed the datatset as 'dfIQR' and will use this method for the remainder of the project. I prefer this so I can go back and run tests on the original 'df' if I need to.

### Q13

Complete exploratory analyses (for each variable) doing appropriate visualizations with ggplot2. Include visualizations that incorporate a combination of your variables within one plot.

```

### Q13 Discussion:

I chose to use Box, Bar, Density and Histogram plots for my analyses of these variables. 

Beginning with the Boxplots, I mainly wanted to know the average distribution of weight across the groupings for cholesterol and arthritis. What I saw is that those who identified as having high cholesterol or arthritis had a higher weight on average. Albeit, the average is not much higher than the "no" group, but the difference is still there.

For the Density plots, I wanted to picture how the ratio of "yes" to "no" changes for cholesterol and and arthritis as weight progresses. You can see for both that, as weight approaches roughly 200 lbs, there is a flip in the proportions of "yes" respondants. This tells me there may be a correlation between weight and arthritis/cholesterol.

The Bar plots are my favorite visualizations of this study because you can see the drastic shift in proportion so well. The first bar plot depicts the proportion of Arthritis respondants for each age variable. As age progresses, the "yes" pool grows larger, until you get to the oldest age bracket, where there are more "yes" respondants than "no". This tells me that age and arthritis may be positively correlated (however, that does not mean they are causal). The second bar plot depicts the proportion of cholesterol respondants who have arthritis. What is striking to me is that the "yes" pool is almost 50/50 for those who do and don't have arthritis. Compare that to the low cholesterol pool, which is about 33/67. Cholesterol and arthritis may be correlated.

Lastly, I chose the histograms as the cherry on top. They basically cover the same information that the density plots give us, but from a different angle. Once again, the ratio of those who do/don't have arthritis/high cholesterol begins to even out (50/50) as weight progresses.

### Q14 Discussion:

Most of what I observed is in the comments, but I will summarize.

Beginning with weight and age, the first thing I noticed is the presence of skew in both variables, especially with age. Age has a high negative (left) skew, with most of the population residing in the higher age brackets. Weight has a smaller, positive (right) skew. The skew for age will most likely impact the data more so than the weight skew, especially if there is correlation between age and the other variables. Despite the graph of the weight variable looking normally distributed, the mode of the variable is roughly 20 lbs higher than the mean. However, I don't think this will impact much.

As for our binary variables - arthritis and cholesterol - the findings seemed more interesting. 35% of participants have arthritis, while 40% have high cholesterol. This proves my theory that the age skew may impact the numbers for these variables if there is, in fact, a correlation. Those are high percentages. From a quick google search, roughly 1 in 4 adults have arthritis, while roughly 10% of adults have high cholesterol. So, our study group may not accurately reflect the population as a whole. This, once again, could be because of the method of the survey.

Another thing to note is the overlap of participants with cholesterol and arthritis. Almost 1/5 of the participants have arthritis AND high cholesterol. At the same time, participants 65+ with arthritis make up 20% of the survey, while people 65+ with high cholesterol ALSO make up 20% of the survey. There must be a considerable amount of overlap there.

I finished with some basic correlation tests. What I found is that age and arthritis have the highest correlation, while each variable seems to be correlated with arthritis significantly.

That being said, this data may be too skewed to give us the most accurate results, since it appears to reflect more upon the older population groups.

### Q15

Finally, run at least 2 different, appropriate regressions predicting the variable you indicated in Q11. These regressions should use different predictor(s). Organize and explain your code within the code chunk using comments. Identify the best model and provide a discussion of your observations in the *Q15 Discussion* section provided below.

### Q15 Discussion:

This was the most enjoyable part of the project to me, because it is the fruit of all the hard work. By this point, I could very well guess what the regressions would tell me, but it was nice to see them confirmed. To summarize, it appears that the best model fit for predicting the odds of arthritis in a participant is the model that uses each variable as a predictor. This AIC was lower than all of the models, and that is the factor that I am using to determine my decision for model fit. I decided to create binomial bins for weight and age, but I believe that these bins were well founded in the stats. There is margin for error, but I would probably get a similar answer if I chose to not create the bins.

I am concerned about the existence of multicollinearity between the indepedent variables. From the visuals, it is clear that correlation exists between all three of them. However, it makes sense to me that these variables can still remain independent of one another when predicting the presence of arthritis in a participant. Old age could be correlated, even causing, arhtritis. So can high cholesterol. Yet, both of those together could increase the risk even more so.

Therefore, I am comfortable saying that the 'modALL' model is the best model, and I would feel comfortable using it to predict responses from a new dataset.
